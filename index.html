  <p><em>Talk is cheap. Show me the code!</em></p>
  <p>I always thought that my dream was to be a nurse, help others and somehow change the world. I gravitated torwards more senior positions and as I was aspiring to do more and more, at a certain point I felt like what I was doing was not enough anymore. I yearned to learn more, create more, do more. </p>
  <p>And that's when it happened. The spark I was missing immediately ignited the second I clicked on a video about Programming. Since then, I can't get enough. The opportunities are endless and Web development calls to all my passions. I can test my creativity and my ability to solve problems (nothing feels better than cracking the code and make it work, right?) </p>
  <p>I am starting my career as a Web Developer but I am a very fast learner and my passion for the subject will always make me strive to be the best.</p>
